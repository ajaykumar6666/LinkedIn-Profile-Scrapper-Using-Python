The efforts to build more natural Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) seem to be not enough where the lack of adaptive capability requires, however, parameters setting activity and then knowledge. The goal of this research project is to build a framework for developing smart devices based on the vector representation of reality, learning capability and adaptive behavior of digital neural networks. Target applications are smart cameras for work environment safety, adaptive automotive drive assistants, intelligent computer peripherals enabling people with any kind of handicap to use computer and communicate. In an other way, these devices could be integrated as transparent learning and adaptive controllers for any kind of domestic and industrial machinery. The goal is the definition of a common Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) framework enabling a fast development of specialized applications with the addition of tailored VHDL components and specific hardware sensors. This framework should be portable on many low cost FPGA development boards.\nINSTRUMENT(S): STREP\nCALL: IST-2002-2.3.2.4 - Cognitive systems   /   IST-2002-2.3.2.5 - Embedded systems""}, {'Title': 'EUCLID', 'Description': 'Design and development of software for the European Union\'s EUCLID project.

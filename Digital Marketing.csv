2,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kritiarneja,"Two things that I am passionate about marketing - how can I get a consumer to buy my product without really asking ze to buy (because nobody wants to be intruded, right?) , and how can I measure and integrate everything I do to get that consumer on board.

I have over 7.5 years of stimulating work experience in Digital Marketing, Account Management and Digital Sales and have managed & served clients across Automotive, Education, Hospitality and FMCG sectors. 

I get fascinated with queer marketing ideas and am always on the go trying to ideate such of these. One of these ideas that I recently experimented was to create a balance sheet of ""Marrying Kriti, Inc "" when I proposed to my then boyfriend (now, husband!). 

Outside of work, I enjoy writing songs, performing Bhangra, hiking and learning about Shaivism.

👇 The travel story of my journey from Cuttack to Noida to Mumbai. 

Btw, Cuttack is a small beautiful city in Odisha. :)

⚡At 14, I dreamt to be an astronaut but figured out I didn't have superpowers to nail at Mathematics. Such a cool dream it was.  

⚡At 18, I didn't go to college (mostly) and spent 11 hrs of my day at a music production house and learned how music is produced. Started songwriting and composing, eventually also started helping local musicians and bands to promote their music online.

⚡At 21, I took admission in a B-School (graduated with a Gold Medal), joined an incubator. Worked with 8 early age startups, helping them in creating marketing plans and that's how I was exposed to the startup ecosystem.

⚡At 22, I met a guy with an awesome idea and became one of the founding member at Dogether, a Facebook Start and NASSCOM selected startup and built the marketing and business development team from scratch from 1 member to 12 member. 
Expanded the business from 1 city to 4 cities in India. 

⚡I left Dogether and decided to work with larger teams, better products and complex problems to solve. 

⚡I contributed to the growth journey of Paytm Insider, promoting some of largest events in India - ISL,PKL,T20,ODI,Brand Factory - Free Shopping Weekend etc. Also, built and promoted a new business vertical - live interactive content from scratch. 

⚡Currently playing an active role in the growth acceleration of Pocket Aces' digital media channels - FilterCopy, Dice Media and Gobble.

Currently, I am also building and growing 2 new social media channels from scratch - Jambo (One of a kind desi Animation Channel), Nutshell (Non-fiction channel)

Slated to take place from 8-10 June 2017 at Le Meridien Kochi this would be worthy investment of time and money for a better tomorrow.\n\nThe idea of organizing such an event arose from the rapidly changing business scenario where the tourism fraternity is heavily dependent on technology and innovations. The transformation is so fast paced that catching up to the pace has become very difficult and by the time you adapt to one, the change may have become obsolete. The changes which are happening over the web space, travel-related software, mobile applications, the turnaround of marketing and sales trends etc inspires us to share and discuss new ideas through the platform provided by the conference.\n\nThe objective of this conference is to prepare the travel and tourism industrialists in India and neighboring countries to understand the importance of web marketing, how to use the resources available online to drive business, get inputs in adapting to the changing technology and acquiring skills to beat the competition.\n\nICTT India will feature eminent speakers from varied backgrounds giving talks and entertaining sessions on various tourism related topics. The idea of the conference being to help the hotels and tour operators in understanding in how to market, sell and generate business online, it would assist tour operators and travel agents to adapt to new trends and help improve generating enquiries and scaling up conversion levels.

41,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shathyan,"Hi, I'm Shathyan, a Digital Media Marketer focused on Performance Marketing in User Acquisition & Product Growth. I have worked extensively on Mobile App Growth & E-commerce.

It all started in 2011 where I was searching on Google on How to Make Money Online and landed up with the term called - Blogging. 

I started blogging and self-learned about content writing, SEO, Social Media to drive traffic to my blog, so that I can make money.  There was lots of experimentation and learnings to understand which works and which does not. 

Slowly after seeing success in Blogging, I started to experiments on more things online like Affiliate Marketing, Paid Marketing, Ecommerce through Dropshipping and learn the basics of Digital Marketing. 

Then joined a couple of high growth startups as an initial employee and witnessed and been part of growing from Zero to Millions of Traffics or App Installs with a solid focus to drive ROI for the business.

I also had my stints into E-commerce twice where I failed due to the operational model which was basically not efficient to scale. But all the learning has made more mature to approach a business and not repeat the same mistakes.

However, failures didn’t stop me from experimenting and trying new things.

I kept working for other startups to prove myself and have grown Vidstatus mobile Apps from Zero Installs to 50+ Million Installs. Also, I have experience in working with VivaVideo App that has more than 800+ Million installs worldwide. 

I understand how a startup works and what is needed for the initial growth. I'm so much obsessed with growth and I follow the AARRR Model for Marketing a Business Online and Grow it.

Performance Marketing is my forte, where I have managed a daily budget of $15,000 for User Acquisition and growth through Facebook, Google Ads. 

This gave me confidence and I started to consult for other startups especially in the E-commerce and Mobile App domains which I truly believe where I can bring the change and grow the business. 

I'm more inclined on data-driven marketing and problem-solving across the funnels of the user's journey  
right from Acquisition, Activation, to the retention of users to the platform.

Do you want to discuss on how I Can help your business grow?  

Reach out to me for a Free 30 Min. Consultation where I can just share my knowledge and experience which can help you.","[{'DegreeName': 'SSLC', 'SchoolName': 'R. S.
